"I've developed a versatile Instagram bot using Selenium that excels in automating a range of tasks tailored to specific project needs. This bot is a multifaceted tool capable of handling tasks such as seamless login to Instagram, efficient utilization of the search bar for content discovery, automated following and unfollowing of accounts, as well as programmatically liking and disliking posts. One of its standout features is its ability to extract valuable insights from top accounts, including follower data, post analytics, and engagement metrics. This automation tool not only simplifies the management of Instagram activities but also empowers data-driven decision-making and strategic planning in a dynamic online environment."
